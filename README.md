Rust again :3

To run, either use 'examples' mode, or place the input files in order to use 'full' mode:
- inputs are placed in `data/<day>/input.txt`, where `day` is 1-12
- outputs will go into `data/<day>/output.txt`

All paths are relative to the project root, and the program should be run from within this directory.
